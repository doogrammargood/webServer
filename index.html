      <p>I am a first year graduate student of Computer Science at Tulane University. My advisor is Michael Mislove, and my office is located in Stanley Thomas 309.</p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>My research interests include quantum computation and Category Theory.
        Computers are physical devices which embody mathematical abstraction.
        They therefore establish a relationship between the material and ideal.
        The Category Theory relates programs to logic, thereby forcing the underlying hardware
        to behave logically. All of these areas deserve careful study rather than lofty speculation.

        I have many hobbies, including juggling, fire spinning, playing guitar, writing, chess, and occasionally coding.
        Here is a grainy picture of me with my feline roommate, Kowboy Charles Mingus. He likes jazz, but I play horror folk.
