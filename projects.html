    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Players X and O (gold and silver) take turns marking squares</li>
      <li>A player can only play on the allowed board (purple), which is determined by the previous moves</li>
      <li>A player captures a board by getting 3 in a row. If the other player gets 2 sets of 3 in a row, he may steal the board.</li>
      <li>The game is won when the largest board is captured.</li>
      <li>If a player is forced to play on a full board he/she may play anywhere within the larger board containing this full board.</li>
      <li>The Toggle Size button creates a new game with a different size.</li>
      <li>The Add Bot creates a bot which uses alpha beta/pruning with a depth search up to 5.</li>
      <li>You can press the Add Bot button again to see the bot play itself. (this takes a little while on the largest board)</li>
      <li>For some reason, this doesn't work on mobile. Possibly due to CSS grid?</li>
      <li>The Undo Move button undoes the last move. If you are playing a bot, you'll have to click it twice to undo the bot's move and your last move.</li>
      <li>Through development, the undo move button has been buggy. It had better work now, because the bot relies on this function.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
      My next project will be to create a program which takes a video of a person juggling balls and uses some computer vision techniques to determine the siteswap.
      Jumbled code can be found <a href= "https://github.com/doogrammargood/potatoWasp">here</a>.
      My plan is the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Apply a background filter based on motion.</li>
          <li>Use Hough Circle detection to find circles, which are hopefully mostly balls.</li>
          <li>Plot these balls and fit parabolas to them.</li>
          <li>Use wishful thinking on throws that are too fast to be captured on camera.</li>
        </ol>
      Interestingly, apart from the wishful thinking, there's no neural networks or probabilistic machine learning.
      When this plan fails, I'll try and train a neural network to watch the juggler's hands to handle the vamps.
