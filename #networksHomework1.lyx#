\begin_layout Problem
Consider the circuit switched network shown in figure 1.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 circuits on each link.
 Label the four switches 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 going in the clockwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
a) What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in
 progrsess in the network at any time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
b) Suppose that all connections are between switches 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
c) Suppose we want to make four connections between switches 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, and another four connections between switches 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 Can we route these calls through the four links to accommodate all eight
 connections?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) We can connect 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A,B\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 times, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(B,C\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 times, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(C,D\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 times, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D,A\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 times for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

 connections.
 There cannot be more, because each each switch only has 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 connections to the network and this scheme uses all 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 connections for each host.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) In this case, we can only have 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 connections, 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 of which go through switch 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 of which go through switch 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 We cannot have more connections between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 because both 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 use all 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 of their connections to the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) Yes.
 We can connect 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A,C\right)$
\end_inset

 twice through the circuit 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

, and twice through the circuit 
\begin_inset Formula $A,D,C$
\end_inset

.
 We can connect 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(B,D\right)$
\end_inset

 twice through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(B,C,D\right)$
\end_inset

 and twice through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(B,A,D\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Review the caravan analogy discussed in class.
 Assume that toll booths are 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

km apart, and the cars propagate at 
\begin_inset Formula $100\frac{km}{hr}$
\end_inset

.
 A toll booth services a car at a rate of one car every 
\begin_inset Formula $12$
\end_inset

 seconds.
 Suppose the caravan (with 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 cars) begins in front of one toll booth, passing through a second tollbooth,
 and finishes just after a third toll booth.
 What is the end-to-end delay? (As we did in class, suppose that whenever
 the first car of the caravan arrives at a toll booth, it waits at the entrance
 until the other nine cars have arrived and lined up behind it.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First note that it takes 
\begin_inset Formula $1hr=60min$
\end_inset

 for a car to travel from tollbooth to tollbooth (the propagation delay).
 It will take 
\begin_inset Formula $12\frac{car}{sec}\cdot10sec=120sec=2min$
\end_inset

 for the caravan to be serviced by the tollbooth.
 It will therefore take 
\begin_inset Formula $62$
\end_inset

 minutes for the last car to reach the second gate.
 The caravan will be in the same scenario as the start of the problem, but
 with one fewer tollbooth and one fewer road to traverse.
 Applying the same logic again demonstrates that it will take 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot62min=124min$
\end_inset

 for the cars to line up at the third toll booth, and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 more minutes for the third tollbooth to service all 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 cars.
 The total end to end delay is therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $126min$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, we can see that there will be 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 tollbooths with delay 
\begin_inset Formula $2min$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 roads each with delay 
\begin_inset Formula $60min$
\end_inset

 which the caravan must travel across.
 The total delay is then 
\begin_inset Formula $3\cdot2min+2\cdot60min=126min$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We would like to transfer a 
\begin_inset Formula $20KB$
\end_inset

 file (
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 Byte = 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 bits) across a network from node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to node 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 The file is broken into 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 packets of length 
\begin_inset Formula $1KB$
\end_inset

 each (neglecting the packet header).
 The path from node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to node 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 passes through 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 links and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 routers.
 Each of the links is a 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

km optical fiber with a transmission rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 Mbps.
 Assume that the speed of light in optical fiber is 
\begin_inset Formula $2.0\times10^{8}\frac{m}{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 routers are store-and-forward devices, and each of them must perform a
 
\begin_inset Formula $50\mu s$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1\mu s=10^{-6}s$
\end_inset

) routing table look up after receiving a packet before it can begin sending
 it on the outgoing link.
 How long does it take to send the entire file across the network?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Observe that except at node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, there will be no queueing delay.
 This is because each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 routers transmits information at the same rate.
 For example, the the end of the second packet will reach node 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $50\mu s+100s$
\end_inset

 (the processing delay plus the transmission delay) after the end of the
 first packet.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will finish the forwarding lookup and finish transmitting the first packet
 as soon as the second packet fully arrives, so there will be no queueing
 delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
However, as I understand the problem, we are not assuming that node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 needs to perform a 
\begin_inset Formula $50\mu s$
\end_inset

 lookup, so there will be some queueing delay at node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 To calculate how much, note that node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 will finish transmitting the last packet will arrive at the queue for node
 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $19\cdot100s=1900s$
\end_inset

 after the first packet.
 It will take node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $19\cdot\left(50\mu s+100\right)$
\end_inset

 to process the 
\begin_inset Formula $19$
\end_inset

 other packets.
 Hence, the last packet must wait at node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $950\mu s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
This is equivalent to assuming that node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does perform a forwarding lookup.
 In this case, the last node waits its extra 
\begin_inset Formula $950\mu s$
\end_inset

 at the beginning rather than at node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there were just 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 packet, it would take 
\begin_inset Formula $5\cdot10km/2.0\times10^{5}\frac{km}{s}+4\cdot10^{-6}s+4\cdot1KB/10Mbs\approx400s$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total time for all 
\begin_inset Formula $20$
\end_inset

 packets is therefore the amount of time it takes for the last packet to
 be sent across the network.
 This is 
\begin_inset Formula $1900s+950\mu s+400s$
\end_inset

, or time until the last packet is sent + time the last packet spends waiting
 + travel time for the last packet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Consider a link with transmission rate 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

bps.
 Suppose every 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 seconds, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 packets arrive simultaneously to the link where each packet is of length
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 bits.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $T\geq LN/R$
\end_inset

.
 What is the average queueing delay of a packet?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $T\geq LN/R$
\end_inset

 implies that the queue will be cleared before the next burst arrives.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $kth$
\end_inset

 packet in a burst will have to wait for 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 packets, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k-1\right)L/R$
\end_inset

 seconds.
 The average queueing delay per packet is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(k-1\right)\frac{L}{R}=\frac{\left(N-1\right)L}{2R}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the packet-average.
 To find the time average, note that there is a total delay of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N\left(N-1\right)L}{2R}$
\end_inset

 packet-seconds.
 The time average delay is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N\left(N-1\right)L}{2RT}$
\end_inset

 packets, meaning that at a given second, we can expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N\left(N-1\right)L}{2RT}$
\end_inset

 packets to be waiting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Consider sending a large file of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 bits from Host 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to Host 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 There are three links and two switches between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, and the links are uncongested (that is, no queueing delays).
 Host 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 segments the file into segments of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 bits each and adds 
\begin_inset Formula $80$
\end_inset

 bits of header to each segment, forming packets of 
\begin_inset Formula $L=80+S$
\end_inset

 bits.
 Each link has a transmission rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

bps.
 Disregard processing delay and propagation delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
a) What is the delay of moving the file from Host 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to Host 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
b) Find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 that minimizes the above delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Disregarding processing delay and propagation delay, we have only to contend
 with transmission delay, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $3\cdot N\cdot\frac{L}{R}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\frac{F}{S}$
\end_inset

 is the number of packets which must be an integer.
 The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 reflects that there are two switches plus the host which must push the
 packets onto the wire.
 The delay, in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D=3\cdot\frac{F}{S}\cdot\frac{80+S}{R}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
with the understanding that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{F}{S}\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

.
 To minimize this quantity, we should find the critical points, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial D}{\partial S}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We can ignore the constants 
\begin_inset Formula $3,F,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{R}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial D}{\partial S}\propto-\frac{80}{S^{2}}
\]

\end_inset
